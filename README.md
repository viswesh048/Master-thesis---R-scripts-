# Master-thesis-Assessment of structural and topographic influences on greenhouse gas flux observations using a footprint model and LIDAR measurements in a peatland ecosystem-
Assessment of structural and topographic influences on greenhouse gas flux observations using a footprint model and LIDAR measurements in a peatland ecosystem is the title of the Master thesis
R scripts for all the performed analysis and visualization for the Master thesis.

Descriptions of the files:

Master_thesis.rmd- contains all the codes for the analysis and visualizations performed during the Master thes

Master_thesis.html- contains the knitted html version of the rmd file.

original_FFP- contains the FFP footprint model created by Kljun et al. (2015) which was used to compute footprints within the rmd file

spatial_FFP- contains the modified FFP footprint model which was integrated to accept a spatial roughness parameter to compute the footprints within the rmd file

user_defined_functions- contains codes for other user defined functions that were useful in the analysis and visualizations in the rmd script.
